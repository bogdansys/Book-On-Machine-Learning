# Stuff to remember

# Overfitting:

Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and
fits the noise in the training data, rather than the underlying pattern.

# Underfitting:

Unable to capture the relationship between the input and output variables accurately, generating a high error rate on both the training set and unseen data.

# With naive bayes missing features are ignored

# Logistic regression is a linear classifier!
