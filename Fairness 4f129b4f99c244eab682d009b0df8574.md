# Fairness

### Independence Criterion

The Independence criterion in the context of machine learning fairness is a requirement that the decisions made by a model should be independent of certain protected attributes, such as race, gender, or religion. This means that the model's predictions should not be systematically different for different groups of people based on these protected attributes.

### Separation Criterion

The Separation criterion is a stronger requirement for fairness, which requires that the model's predictions for different groups of people should be equivalent or indistinguishable. This means that the model should not only be independent of protected attributes but also that its performance should be the same across different groups.

In other words, the Independence criterion states that the model should not discriminate based on protected attributes, while the Separation criterion states that the model should not only not discriminate but also should be fair in its predictions for all groups.
